# This is a regression test for a BSD pty bug in Mosh.  On
# FreeBSD/OpenBSD/OS X, a pty master can block on read() after
# select() has informed us that there is data available, if a ^S is
# written to the pty master between the select() and the read().
#
# Unfortunately, everything attached to the pty gets stuck when this
# happens.  If this tests fails, you will need to do some manual
# cleanup with kill -9.
